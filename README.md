# node.js getting started - an income tax calculator (copy)

This is a simple, but incomplete, tax calculator for the purpose of learning how to expand on a simple program.

It works out the tax on an income using the [English and Welsh tax rates for 2022/23](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates).

You can use this [online tax calculator](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/tax-calculator/) to verify the tax for a given salary.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) installed.

## Commands

### Install dependencies

Before you can run any other commands you need to install the dependencies for this project:

`yarn install`

### Running the tests

To the tests:

`yarn test:unit`

Or you can leave the tests running as you work:

`yarn watch`

### Running the calculator

`yarn start`

You will be prompted to enter your annual salary and then it will output the amount of tax you would pay.

## Completing the program

This program is incomplete, it has only been written to work out the tax for the basic tax band (up to an income of Â£50,270).

Any income above that will result in an incorrect amount of tax.

However, the tests have already been written for the higher and additional tax rates. So all you need to do is modify the implementation of the `calculate` function in `src/tax-calculator.js` to implement the remaining logic.

Focus on getting the tests to pass first.

Once the tests are passing review the function and see if you can improve the implementation.
